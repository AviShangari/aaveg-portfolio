      <h1>Life Expectancy Prediction</h1>
      <p><strong>Project Type:</strong> Data Science · Regression Analysis</p>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        This project explores the relationship between socioeconomic,
        environmental, and health indicators and their effect on national life
        expectancy. Using data from the World Health Organization, the model
        predicts life expectancy based on over 20 variables such as immunization
        rate, GDP, BMI, and HIV prevalence.
      </p>

      <h3>ML Pipeline</h3>
      <p>
        The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers, then
        standardized and split into training and testing sets. A linear
        regression model was trained and evaluated using metrics like RMSE and
        R². Feature importance was visualized to identify key predictors
        influencing life expectancy outcomes.
      </p>

      <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
      <p>Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn</p>
