      <h1>Mental Health Classifier</h1>
      <p><strong>Project Type:</strong> AI/ML · Binary Classification</p>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        This project explores the impact of remote work on mental health by
        training a neural network to predict depression based on survey
        responses. The dataset includes demographic and work-related features,
        all of which are encoded and used to train a PyTorch-based model.
      </p>

      <h3>Motivation</h3>
      <p>
        As remote work continues to grow, there’s a growing concern about its
        long-term impact on employee well-being. This project aims to understand
        which factors most significantly correlate with mental health conditions
        like depression and whether we can reliably predict risk using basic
        survey data. The goal is to use machine learning not just for
        prediction, but also to inform better workplace strategies and support
        systems.
      </p>

      <h3>Approach</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and trends
          in the dataset
        </li>
        <li>
          Encoded categorical variables using <code>pandas.factorize()</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          Split the dataset into train/test using
          <code>train_test_split()</code> from Scikit-learn
        </li>
        <li>
          Constructed a simple fully connected neural network using PyTorch
        </li>
        <li>
          Trained the model with binary cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer
        </li>
        <li>Evaluated accuracy and logged performance results for insights</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
      <p>Python, Pandas, PyTorch, Scikit-learn</p>
