      <h1>CT to MRI Translation Using CycleGAN</h1>
      <p><strong>Project Type:</strong> Deep Learning · Image Translation</p>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        This project applies a CycleGAN-based architecture to translate CT scans
        into MRI images and vice versa. The model learns domain-specific
        features from each modality and performs unpaired image-to-image
        translation using cycle consistency. This enables synthetic generation
        of one modality from the other without requiring aligned datasets.
      </p>

      <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
      <p>
        Medical imaging modalities like CT and MRI provide complementary views
        of anatomy, but acquiring both can be expensive, time-consuming, or
        contraindicated. A tool that can generate one from the other helps in
        clinical decision support, data augmentation, or low-resource settings
        where one modality is unavailable.
      </p>

      <h3>How It Works</h3>
      <p>
        The system uses two generator-discriminator pairs trained adversarially.
        Cycle consistency ensures that an image translated from CT to MRI and
        back remains faithful to the original. This method allows the model to
        retain anatomical structure while adapting texture, brightness, and
        contrast between domains.

      <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
      <p>Python, PyTorch, CycleGAN, NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib</p>
