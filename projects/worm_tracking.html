      <h1>Microscopic Worm Tracking Thesis</h1>
      <p><strong>Project Type:</strong> Undergraduate Thesis (2024–2025)</p>

      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        In behavioral and biomedical research, model organisms like
        <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em> are commonly used to study the effects
        of chemical exposure, mutations, or environmental changes on movement.
        Analyzing their motion can reveal deeper insights into neuromuscular
        function and drug effects. However, their highly deformable and
        translucent nature makes them difficult to track accurately in video
        footage.
      </p>

      <h3>Limitations of Past Approaches</h3>
      <p>
        Many traditional tracking methods treat worms as rigid shapes or points,
        using bounding boxes or optical flow. While computationally efficient,
        these approaches fail to capture the worm’s posture or shape, and often
        break down when worms touch or overlap. Deep learning–based pose
        estimation methods provide better detail, but require large annotated
        datasets and struggle with generalizing to low-contrast or crowded
        videos.
      </p>

      <h3>Our Approach</h3>
      <p>
        This project introduces a lightweight, training-free tracking system
        that captures both the identity and the body posture of each worm.
        Instead of representing worms as blobs or single points, the software
        models the full structure of the worm's body in each frame. As the worms
        move, bend, or intersect, the system maintains their individual identity
        while preserving their posture over time.
      </p>

      <p>
        This posture-aware motion tracking allows for more detailed behavioral
        analysis without the need for neural networks or labeled training data.
        The design is optimized for consistency, interpretability, and
        robustness across varied video conditions.
      </p>

      <h3>Outcomes & Applications</h3>
      <p>
        The final tool enables researchers to study worm movement at both macro
        and micro levels. It can help quantify changes in body posture,
        locomotion efficiency, and behavioral trends across experimental
        conditions. The system is also efficient enough to run on standard
        consumer-grade machines, making it accessible for labs with limited
        resources.
