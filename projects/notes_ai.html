      <p><strong>Project Type:</strong> Cross-Platform AI App · NLP</p>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Notes.AI is a cross-platform mobile application designed to enhance
        note-taking using natural language processing. The app helps users
        organize their thoughts, summarize content, and auto-complete ideas
        using generative AI. It combines a sleek user interface with intelligent
        backend services to streamline the writing process.
      </p>

      <h3>AI Features</h3>
      <p>
        Users can generate summaries of long paragraphs, auto-complete
        unfinished sentences, and expand brief notes into more detailed entries.
        The AI engine is powered by Cohere’s large language models and OpenAI
        APIs, integrated with a custom Python backend.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system also supports self-learning: users can manually tag their
        notes, and when a new tag is introduced, the app generates example
        entries for that tag and retrains itself to improve classification and
        suggestion accuracy over time.
      </p>

      <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
      <p>Flutter, Dart, Firebase, Flask, Python, Cohere, OpenAI APIs, REST</p>
